This is a simple React application that demonstrates how to use React Query for managing server state and making API requests. The app allows users to view, create, update, and delete user data stored on a mock API server. React Query is used to fetch and manage the data, while React Router is used for client-side routing. The application also includes form validation using Yup and styled components for styling. The project is intended to be used as a starting point for building more complex React applications that require data management and API integration.
